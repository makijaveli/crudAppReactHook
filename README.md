# crudAppReactHook
Crud App for learning React hooks and Context API.

In this project, you will use Context API and React hooks together to build a fully functional CRUD application that emulates a list of employees. It will read employee data, create new employees, update employee data, and delete employees. Note, that this tutorial will not be using any external API calls. For the sake of demonstration, it will be using hard-coded objects which will serve as the state.
